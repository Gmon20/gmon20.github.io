I have been sitting on this idea for a VERY long time, but I have been thinking of forming a band of some kind. 

I wanted to just try doing things on my own at first, but trying to learn the parts for 3 or 4 other people on top of your own while also attempting to mix and
master everything by yourself is a LOT of work (I have attempted this in the past so I know lol). And that's just with covers-I have ZERO good ideas for making
original music. How would I even go about picking a genre? Things like "not country but anything else works" or "something Vocaloid-y" are just too vague to start
with! So that's why I'm looking for other people to work with.

As for instrumentation, I'm down for anything, but we'll need at least 1 person to fill the roles of drums/bass/chords/etc. It's okay if we end up with something
goofy like 3 clarinets and a cello-that just means we get to be more creative lol. As long as you can play well enough, I'll be glad to have you!

If you're wondering about things like what type of band this will be, what genre we'll primarily be playing, how/where we'll rehearse-that will all come together
after the members have been selected. I want this to be something that we all decide on as a group, and I want something that works for everyone. I am currently
based in OKC, but if you live a bit farther away, we can always do things partially/completely online! Ideally, this will eventually turn into a paid gig, but
since this is still in this "very rough concept" stage, plan on this being a volunteer only sort of thing for now.

If you're interested in joining, fill out this google form: https://forms.gle/BevpfqAvEMCfGeiE9 I'll keep it open until I have enough people to form a band. 
Thanks for reading!

If you'd like to see some of the arrangements I've made (plus a lot of other content), here's my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJytiPkiNIbC4mgllC4MZEA

My content normally consists of my arrangements and videos involving games or game consoles, the latter typically being on the more light hearted side!

Most of my arrangements normally just go straight to MuseScore, so here's the link if you want to check those out: https://musescore.com/globuscus
Keep in mind that with the exception of Coconut Mall, I made most of these knowing that I could get away with a lot simply because I knew no one was planning on performing any of these pieces anytime soon (for example, constantly forgetting to fix steel pan range issues until AFTER I post the music).
If you are interested in playing any of my arrangements in the future, please let me know! I'd be more than happy to make stuff more readable if needed haha (I definitely had to do that for Coconut Mall...)

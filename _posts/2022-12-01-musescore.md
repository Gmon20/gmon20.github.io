Most of my arrangements normally just go straight to MuseScore, so here's the link if you want to check those out: https://musescore.com/globuscus
If you are interested in playing any of my arrangements in the future, please let me know! I'd be more than happy to make stuff more readable if needed haha (I definitely had to do that for Coconut Mall...)

Some of my arrangements have been published (see the related post for more details on that), so if you'd like to support me, feel free to take a look at them and purchase one if you'd like!

I also have an Audio.com account! Most of my arrangements are available in a sheet music-free form over there, so here's the link if you want to take a look: https://audio.com/gmon23/collections

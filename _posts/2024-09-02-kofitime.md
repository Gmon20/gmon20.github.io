I just opened up a Ko-Fi page! Here's the link: ko-fi.com/gmon85573 
Essentially, I'll be using it for taking song requests. If there's a song you'd like me to arrange, let me know with a donation and I'll get to work! 
I'll also post it on my YouTube channel (or not, if you'd like-just let me know!). Until I'm able to get more freelance gigs, I'm going to try this 
out as another source of income.

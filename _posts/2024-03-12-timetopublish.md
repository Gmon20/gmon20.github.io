I mentioned this at the end of my MuseScore post, but i am finally in the process of getting my scores published! I only have one o right now (I'll have to grab the link later, but it should be "One-Winged Angel" on sheetmusicplus), but eventually I plan on getting as many of my arrangements as possible from
MuseScore to a different site where I can actually sell them. It may take a while, since I'll have to sift through all of my eligible scores and make sure they're all playable, but I'll get there eventually lol.
And once I get things a little more organized, I'll update this post with a link to everything! (and I'll replace the placeholder images with better ones lol)

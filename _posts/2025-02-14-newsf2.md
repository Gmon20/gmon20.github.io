Yep, you heard that right...I created my own custom sf2 file!

You may be wondering, "why on earth would you do that," or "what is an sf2 file??" Well, allow me to explain.

Long story short, I wanted to get my hands on/recreate the Korg Miku Stomp guitar pedal, but that was not going to happen any time soon lol. This was my way of
attempting to get around that somehow. By creating a custom sf2 file, I basically have my own (janky) version of the pedal that I can use with programs like MuseScore.
If enough people want to hear the long version, I'll gladly make a video about how I went through the whole process. It's definetly far from perfect, but at 
least 1 of the instruments sounds decent enough so I'll take it lol. Here's a clip of what the xylo and vibes sound like: https://youtu.be/ll5eS0ghTCQ

There are a TON of issues with the file (like the bass notes lagging behind, weird attacks with the glockenspiel, and a lot of other things), so I'm honestly not
sure if I'll even find a use for this thing anytime soon, but at least now I can say I've made my own sf2 before lol.
